      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not much for revisiting the past. I suppose this is both a good thing and a bad thing but for whatever reason I much prefer looking down the road ahead. At the very least I avoid a sore neck by rarely looking over my shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So after a couple years of silence I decided to nuke several years of content and start fresh. No excess baggage. No maintenance, just a clean slate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m also somewhat averse to following plans. I&amp;rsquo;d rather follow whims. And so, as before, it is difficult to say what will end up here. I would imagine there will be some tech (I&amp;rsquo;ve been in IT, primarily as a software developer, for over 30 years), some music (I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing some instrument or another since I was 5 and studied music in college), and some&amp;hellip; well, meandering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so it begins.&lt;/p&gt;
